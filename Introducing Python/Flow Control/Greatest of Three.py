# Given three numbers a, b, and c. You need to find which is the greatest of them all.

# Examples:

# Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Clearly, c = 3 is the greatest of (1, 2, 3)
# Input: a = 2, b = 2, c = 5
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Out of (2, 2, 5) 5 is the greatest.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= a, b, c <= 103

#User function Template for python3
# Take a, b and c input and print the greatest of three
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

if a > b:
    if a > c:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(c)
if b > a:
    if b > c:
        print(b)
    else:
        print(c)
