# Given two numbers a and b, you need to swap their values so a holds the value of b and b holds the value of a. Just write the code to swap values of a and b at the specified place.

# Examples

# Input: a = 1, b = 2
# Output: 2 1
# Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2, now a = 2 and b = 1.
# Input: a = 6, b = 7  
# Output: 7 6 
# Explanation: Initially a = 6 and b = 7, now a = 7 and b = 6.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

########### Write your code below ###############

c = a
a = b
b = c

########### Write your code above ###############

print(a, b)
