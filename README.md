# Master Python — Complete Beginner to Advanced (GfG)  
*Repository of solutions to the GeeksforGeeks “Master Python” course problems*

## 🧩 Purpose of This Repo  

- To store my personal solutions to every problem/exercise in the course  
- To help me track progress and revise later  
- To provide a reference / learning aid for others (after they’ve tried themselves)  
- *Not* meant to be a “cheat sheet” to skip learning — I strongly encourage you to attempt the problems yourself first

---

## 🎯 How This Repo Is Structured  

Typical layout:

- Each module (or topic) has its own folder  
- File names reflect the problem (or include numbering)  
- Solutions are in Python (unless otherwise noted)  
- I might include comments, explanations, or alternate approaches

## 🚀 How to Use This Wisely  

1. **Do the problem yourself first** — Resist the urge to peek immediately.  
2. Use my solution as a **learning reference**, not a substitute.  
3. Compare your approach vs mine — see where you can optimize, adapt, or strengthen your logic.  
4. If you get stuck, try to debug your own code before jumping to the solution.  
5. Use branches/forks if you plan to add your own variants or improvements.

---

## 📖 What You’ll Find  

- Complete set of solved problems corresponding to the GfG course  
- Some problems may have multiple solution variants (e.g. iterative / recursive)  
- Inline comments and explanations to clarify tricky logic  
- Occasionally, “notes” files with tips or caveats

## ⚠️ A Friendly Warning (and Encouragement)  

> **Please do not treat this repository as a place to just copy-paste solutions.**  
> Your learning and growth come from trying, failing, debugging, and persisting.  
> Use these solutions *after* you’ve given each problem a fair attempt.  
>  
> If you just follow solutions blindly, the value of doing the course is diminished.
