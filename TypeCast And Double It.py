# Given an input num as a string. You need to typecast into an integer and double it. 

# Examples:

# Input: num = "5"
# Output: 10
# Explanation: Typecast "5" to int and then double it 5 * 2 = 10
# Input: num = "12"
# Output: 24
# Explanation: Typecast "12" to int and then double it 12 * 2 = 24
# Constraints:
# 0 <= num <= 105

num = input()
#code here
print(int(num)*2)
